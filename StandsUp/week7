what did I done in the past week?
start a new sprint: time series anlysis and forcasting.
learn Discriminant Analysis, support vector machine, random forest
Sprint ecexution: Use open source code and up list classifiers to predict S&P500 closing price(equities benchmark.), 
forming a basis for a systematic trading strategy if accuracy exceeds 50%.

Challenge encountered in the past week?
coding debugging: Replaced pandas.io.data.DataReader with yfinance to fetch stock data
classifiers move to different module or libraries

What will I do in the next week?
Strategy improvment: Trade Analysis(ex. sharpe ratio, Compound Annual Growth Rate)
                     Drawdown Analysis, Risk Considerations
(insights into how a strategy might behave during adverse conditions and help in setting risk limits like "stop-loss" thresholds.)
