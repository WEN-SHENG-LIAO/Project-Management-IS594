what did I done in the past week?
 I set up my final research paper framework
 understanding the difference between FA and TA (Advantage and disadvantage)
 gather information about stock investment philosophy(top-down vs bottom-up)

Challenge encountered in the past week?
 There is no the best investment method  
 What is quantitative trading?

What will I do in the next week?
 Re-scope: instead of competeing two methods, why didn't combine both to maximize the profit 
 follow business news (follow the trend of economic indicadors)
