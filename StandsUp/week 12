What did I do in the past week?
  Implemented Bayesian optimization as an enhancement over random search. 
  This approach used prior performance data to guide parameter selection, improving the efficiency of the search process.

Bayesian Optimization for a Moving Average Crossover Strategy in algorithmic trading.
Moving Average Parameters、Stop-Loss and Take-Profit Levels、Position Sizing、Volatility Filter、Trade Execution Delay

Challenges encountered in the past week:

While Bayesian optimization reduced the number of iterations, it introduced complexity in setting up the prior distribution and tuning the acquisition function. 
Understanding and debugging these components required significant time.

What will I do in the next week?
Test Bayesian Optimization with Reduced Parameter Sets: Simplify the parameter space by focusing on the most impactful parameters identified so far. 
This will streamline the optimization process and improve interpretability.
