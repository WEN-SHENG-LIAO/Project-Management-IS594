What did I do in the past week?
Refined Bayesian Optimization with Reduced Parameter Sets: Focused on key parameters such as moving average lengths (short_ma and long_ma), 
stop-loss levels, and take-profit levels, using ranges identified from sensitivity analysis. This allowed faster and more efficient optimization.

Implemented Walk-Forward Analysis: Tested the optimized parameters in sequential, non-overlapping historical data windows to simulate how the strategy 
would adapt to changing market conditions over time.

Challenges encountered in the past week:
Parameter Stability Across Walk-Forward Windows: Optimized parameters performed inconsistently across different market regimes. While they excelled in trending markets, 
their performance dropped significantly in range-bound or volatile conditions.

What will I do in the next week?
Develop a Hybrid Parameter Strategy: Combine static optimized parameters with dynamic adjustments for specific regimes 
(e.g., use tighter stop-loss in volatile conditions and wider ones in trending markets)
to improve adaptability and robustness.
