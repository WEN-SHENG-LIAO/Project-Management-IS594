What did I do in the past week?

Moving Average Crossover Strategy(It involves using two moving averages with different time periods
—a short-term and a long-term moving average—to generate buy and sell signals based on their interactions.)

I began implementing a basic moving average crossover strategy using the event-driven framework, 
understanding its significance for testing the backtesting system.

Challenges encountered in the past week:
translating the moving average crossover strategy logic into the framework was initially difficult due to the nuanced handling of signals and orders. 
There was also the added complexity of backtesting with realistic transaction costs and data frequency.

What will I do in the next week?
I may try some of the other strategies based on intraday equities data
