What did I do in the past week?
  I performed cross-validation on the optimized strategy, applying it to different historical periods. 
  This helped assess the robustness of the strategy and identified any parameter sets that might lead to overfitting.

Challenges encountered in the past week
  One challenge was interpreting the results from random search and cross-validation, 
  as certain parameter combinations performed well on some historical periods but not others, 
  making it difficult to find a consistently strong set of parameters.
  For example, parameters optimized for a high-volatility period didnâ€™t generalize well to low-volatility periods, 
  leading to inconsistent strategy performance.

What will I do in the next week?
  I plan to analyze the results from the cross-validation tests further to determine 
  if certain parameter ranges perform consistently across multiple periods, 
  rather than focusing on one specific set of parameters.
