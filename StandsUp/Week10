What did I do in the past week?
Focused on understanding optimization techniques for algorithmic strategies. 
I explored different parameter optimization methods like grid search and cross-validation
, which help in selecting the best parameters for a trading strategy.

Started implementing parameter sensitivity analysis to assess how changes in key inputs (e.g., moving average period) 
impact the strategyâ€™s performance.

Challenges encountered in the past week:
One challenge was managing the trade-off between optimizing parameters for maximum performance and avoiding overfitting. With numerous parameters, 
it was easy to overfit the model to historical data, which could negatively impact real-world performance.

What will I do in the next week?
I plan to implement cross-validation techniques to validate the strategy on different datasets and reduce the risk of overfitting.
